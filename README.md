The project was created for Hackaton WiCHacks.
It sends an API request to Purple Air website and gets air pollution data (PM2.5 and PM10).
Then, it uses Twilio to send a text message to notify about air quality in some location.
Currently the location is fixed and will need to be updated.  
I'd also like to update it so it runs with Google Cloud scheduler to send regular updates.
